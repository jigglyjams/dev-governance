WAGMI is currently working on a Smörgåsbord of artistic and educational endeavors for Juicebox. Juicebox High, a 101 or Juicebox for Dummies that should help onboard normies. Edu videos, and more cultural assets for promising projects like BaNounas, a Banny powered auction NFT project that show cases the tech for anyone that wants to boot up their own BaNounas style auction project that runs on Juicebox.
