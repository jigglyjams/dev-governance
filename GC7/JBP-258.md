## Thesis

WAGMI is currently working on a Smörgåsbord of artistic and educational endeavors for Juicebox. Juicebox High, a 101 or Juicebox for Dummies that should help onboard normies. Edu videos, and more cultural assets for promising projects like BaNounas, a Banny powered auction NFT project that show cases the tech for anyone that wants to boot up their own BaNounas style auction project that runs on Juicebox. 

WAGMI also helps adds value to things like the docs, youtube, discord and the newsletter by creating cool headers and art/illustrations.
