University web3 clubs has been one of my focus points but I am also doing a lot of outreach with in other DAOs, project builders and founders to see if there can be some overlap between their goals and JBs.  \n\nAs a result of some of the onboarding I have done, I have been able to catch some bugs with in the frontend and the protocol.  I have also had the opportunity to share some of my personal findings from project creators and have shared those thoughts with JB and Peel.  I believe JB values my opinion and trusts that I have a good pulse on what project creators are looking for.  \n\nI want to continue to also add a social media presence.  The weekly threads keep the DAO informed on some of the topical data. Overall I believe I help the ecosystem.  I am always trying to connect people to help projects move forward.  \n\n**Media**\n\n[Defiant Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObYlVZfO3sY)\n\nStanford Blockchain talk about Juicebox Architecture \n\nWeb3 Galaxy Brain episode with Nader (I categorize this as JB related because of the partnership we are trying to strike with Developer Dao)\n\n**Business Development**\n\nStanford Blockchain - in talks\n\nUCI blockchain - in talks\n\nCal Berkeley Blockchain - in talks\n\nUniversity of New South Wales - in talks\n\nDeveloper DAO (handed off to nicholas)\n\nSince July 7, I have had 27 appointments for onboarding and that has evolved into countless “side” calls to continue to offer support. \n\n## Risks\n\nI could stop doing work.  \n\n## Timeline\n\nFC#31\n"
