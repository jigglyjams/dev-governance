## **Thesis:**

The governance process is essential to the operation of a DAO. Juicebox DAO needs governance automation in order to ensure proposals are carried from idea to execution in an accurate and timely manner.

## **Abstract:**

If you are reading this proposal, you understand how important governance is to JuiceboxDAO

## **Motivation:**

In the past, filipv and stevie g were the governance facilitators for the DAO and would manually shuttle data between the gov tech stack. With the development of nance, this is no long

## **Specification:**

Add jigglyjams.eth to the JuiceboxDAO recurring payouts at $4,800 for FC#26-32

## **Rationale:**

Jigglyjams is taking on risk by leaving his full time job in order to develop the nance platform. The development of nance will be beneficial to JB and the greater DAO ecosystem.

## **Risks:**

The DAO may not feel that they get the request amount of value out of the nance platform.

## **Timeline:**

This proposal shall take effect following the FC#26 Snapshot vote and shall end after FC#32
