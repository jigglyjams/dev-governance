WAGMI is currently working on a Smörgåsbord of artistic and educational endeavors for Juicebox. Juicebox High, a 101 or Juicebox for Dummies that should help onboard normies. Edu videos, and more cultural assets for promising projects like BaNounas, a Banny powered auction NFT project that show cases the tech for anyone that wants to boot up their own BaNounas style auction project that runs on Juicebox. \n\nWAGMI also helps adds value to things like the docs, youtube, discord and the newsletter by creating cool headers and art/illustrations. \n\n## Motivation\n\n_Why now? What problems does this solve?_\n\nWAGMI continues to be a vital part of JB by adding art and illustrations that bolsters the website/protocol and brings attention and interest to the project. When Juicebox is brought up in conversation it is never without a comment about the hilarious and fun art that comes along with it. WAGMI wants to continue to bring life and entertainment to the protocol. \n\n## Specification\n\nRecurring payout in the amount of: $10,000/Funding Cycle\n\n=\n\n$4000 Sage {Art, Illustration, Design, UI, Bannyverse Co Designer, Implementation}\n\n$3000 Burtula {Animation, Pixel Banny Creator, Bannyverse Co Designer, Bannyverse Collateral}\n\n$2000 Mieos {Art Direction/Curation, Communications, Connect of dots, Pusher-man}\n$1000 [not assigned yet] { meme propagation and content organization which includes stickers, emojis, general wagmi content ex: Giphy, tenor, etc platforms up to date with new stickes/emojis/gifs }\n\n## Rationale\n\n• Worked on the visual design aspect of the locked JBX NFT project which will bring better incentives to governance and exposure to Juicebox \n\n• Using and teaching others features like Project payer address to sell NFT’s into Treasury\n\n• Created 36 emojis and over 85 stickers which gives life to the JB Discord\n\n• Created logo, iconic Banny and other Juicebox characters featured on the website\n\n• Creating high quality cultural assets for iconic moments in JB history and for yearly events.\n\n• Collaborating with Lexicon Devils to create a unique digital hangout/education center in Crypto Voxels for Juicebox\n\n• Educational videos to help explain the more technical features of JB\n\n• WAGMI worked on the marketing collateral and assets for the big Morgensterns Ice Cream Event. Which we hope to make art and illustrations for future collaborations! \n\n• Helping with UI for Juicebox High \n\n• Working on JuiceBox NFT Martketplace with Tankbottoms. [https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/user](https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/user)\n\n We collaborated with Jango, Tankbottoms, NatashaPankina, Viraz, Mr. Goldstein and others to create a Locked JBX voting NFT that will be beautifully unique in all of web3. \n\nMOVING FORWARD: \n\n• WAGMI Studios wrapped the voting token work and the Bannyverse is basically ready as a dope PFP projects that runs on Juicebox and helps cement Banny as a seminal character Web3. WAGMI is working on a Smörgåsbord of artistic and educational endeavors for Juicebox. Juicebox High, a 101 or Juicebox for Dummies that should help onboard normies. Edu videos, and more cultural assets for promising projects like BaNounas, a Banny powered auction NFT project that show cases the tech for anyone that wants to boot up their own BaNounas style auction project that runs on Juicebox. \n\n• Continue to experiment using Art, Design, and Animation to expand the cultural reach of Juicebox and Banny. \n\n• Bring the heat to V2. Making sure people understand the value and are exited to jump in! Continue to create education tutorials and animations & info graphics to help onboard and explain new features for V2\n\n• Continue to add value to other projects around the ecosystem though support, education, and unique high quality cultural assets. We will constantly strive to bring community support from every angle including 1 on 1 to make sure every JB project has every tool and understanding they need to succeed! \n\n• Keep making cool stickers and emojis for people to use throughout discord and twitter. Also stickers can be used for future NFT projects. \n• Continue to be ‘on-demand’ artists and illustrators for people in the Juicebox community \n\n• Continue to help with the newsletter by creating graphics/illustrations\n\n• Continue to help with the layout/design and UI for Juicebox High \n\n<u>**WTF is a Funding Cycle:**</u>\n\n[image](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7674c4e7-5ce6-4823-b02a-397db85b578b/WTFunding_Cycles.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220915%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220915T143945Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=ce2eb5638a637a9cb5fb7732c72e38bd1aafb7aa5775ca3498231611fb7343a6&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n<u>**Info Graphics:**</u>\n\n\t\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6dc1d94d-c212-495c-afa4-6cb0a2cc47b8/crashcourse.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220915%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220915T143945Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d8e8cc3e537e0cbbfaaeb565aac17d3ee694b405087013a559e9059331294b6d&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\t\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4751c0ee-aaa4-4c46-a4a1-8867a8ba373c/v2infograph_2.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220915%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220915T143945Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=3f65b3a8e9ba7625a819f3eacf0c65e478edd58e5683e54706c5d83f8643d442&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\t\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/32a86d62-bd66-4e54-b6d8-4c8c2f2d3172/juiceboxhigh.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220915%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220915T143946Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=3190c1cde2d2e38389f7fa2208db8f4295b727fdb8749fabbd33dafd8bb27ea4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\t\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e6d20521-9021-4b90-b502-5c56419f3523/stickers.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220915%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220915T143946Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=1df9811f2321de762c17667d86a2d0d93dc6babe1b6133dada605f65e9c3c510&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n<u>**Membership NFT’s for when JB launches NFT reward tiers:**</u>\n\n![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/152ab079-5b81-4241-baa5-6d9e34fbb195/Screen_Shot_2022-08-01_at_4.12.40_PM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220915%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220915T143945Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=e90f128936bf7e2a8afda12773c22d0c5c63856444db11ab2124478c407af3f7&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n## Risks\n\nThe risks are not respecting the ETH.

University web3 clubs has been one of my focus points but I am also doing a lot of outreach with in other DAOs, project builders and founders to see if there can be some overlap between their goals and JBs.  \n\nAs a result of some of the onboarding I have done, I have been able to catch some bugs with in the frontend and the protocol.  I have also had the opportunity to share some of my personal findings from project creators and have shared those thoughts with JB and Peel.  I believe JB values my opinion and trusts that I have a good pulse on what project creators are looking for.  \n\nI want to continue to also add a social media presence.  The weekly threads keep the DAO informed on some of the topical data. Overall I believe I help the ecosystem.  I am always trying to connect people to help projects move forward.  \n\n**Media**\n\n[Defiant Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObYlVZfO3sY)\n\nStanford Blockchain talk about Juicebox Architecture \n\nWeb3 Galaxy Brain episode with Nader (I categorize this as JB related because of the partnership we are trying to strike with Developer Dao)\n\n**Business Development**\n\nStanford Blockchain - in talks\n\nUCI blockchain - in talks\n\nCal Berkeley Blockchain - in talks\n\nUniversity of New South Wales - in talks\n\nDeveloper DAO (handed off to nicholas)\n\nSince July 7, I have had 27 appointments for onboarding and that has evolved into countless “side” calls to continue to offer support. \n\n## Risks\n\nI could stop doing work.  \n\n## Timeline\n\nFC#31\n"
