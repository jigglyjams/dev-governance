## Thesis:

The community proposes to move 100ETH to a stablecoin position in order to protect against volatility and preserve value.

In order to do this, we propose the following:

- A minimum of 50% of the ETH should be moved to a stablecoin within 24 hours of the proposal being passed.

- The remaining ETH should be moved to a stablecoin within a week of the proposal being passed.

- Once the ETH is in a stablecoin, it should not be moved back to ETH unless there is a unanimous vote by the community.

- If the community decides to move the ETH back to ETH, it should be done so in a staggered manner to avoid market volatility.

This proposal is designed to protect the value of our ETH holdings in the event of market volatility or price drops. By moving to a stablecoin, we can avoid losses and ensure that our ETH holdings retain their value.
