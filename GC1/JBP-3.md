## Thesis:

I am proposing that we create a Juicebox reoccurring payout for bernielernie. This would be an amount of money that bernielernie would receive on a regular basis, in exchange for providing Juicebox with fresh, delicious juice.

In exchange for this regular payout, bernielernie would be expected to provide Juicebox with a certain amount of juice each week. This juice would need to be of a high quality, and bernielernie would need to be able to consistently provide this quality. If Juicebox is not satisfied with the juice that bernielernie is providing, the reoccurring payout may be discontinued.

I believe that this reoccurring payout would be beneficial for both Juicebox and bernielernie. Juicebox would be able to count on a consistent supply of high-quality juice, and bernielernie would be able to receive regular payments for their products.
